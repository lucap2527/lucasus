# College Board Practice MC Corrections

## Question 6
![baka](https://github.com/lucap2527/lucasus/blob/gh-pages/Screenshot%202022-04-24%20110534.png)
* Rattrap similar and today should be the answer because the code tracks for the letters "art" rather than the full word to see if it matches anywhere within the word
## Question 7
![sus](https://github.com/lucap2527/lucasus/blob/gh-pages/Screenshot%202022-04-24%20110805.png)
* The output below matches the question code output, therefor this would be the correct answer. The one I had chosen was neither in the right order or had the right number or type of values that should be outputted.

## Question 14
![bakky](https://github.com/lucap2527/lucasus/blob/gh-pages/Screenshot%202022-04-24%20111008.png)
* Because the method isn't checking wether or not a has a greater than or EQUAL TO value compared to b the method may not work properly if they have the same values and it will output c instead.
## Question 19
![bakkkyy](https://github.com/lucap2527/lucasus/blob/gh-pages/Screenshot%202022-04-24%20111444.png)
* Because the x value starts at 1, the first condition wont run the while code at all, and the other two wont output anything because adding 2 to 1 while the while condition is true will never make the value even.
## Question 22
![22](https://github.com/lucap2527/lucasus/blob/gh-pages/Screenshot%202022-04-24%20111729.png)
* A is the correct code because it outputs by the row, than by the individual term least to greatest in terms of n of that row, so as n gets added 1 each time it moves down the row outputting 123456.
## Question 26
![26](https://github.com/lucap2527/lucasus/blob/gh-pages/Screenshot%202022-04-24%20111926.png)
* Because the change it code only changes the values within the respected method, it doesn't actually change the value and the other method start will print 123456 blackboard
## Question 27
![27](https://github.com/lucap2527/lucasus/blob/gh-pages/Screenshot%202022-04-24%20112517.png)
* The code at hand does not sort the data properly, so instead of least to greatest order throughout the whole data array, the last couple values will be switched due to code faults.
## Question 28
* Same code as above
* The first value is already assigned to temp, therefore the temp assigned code only needs to run 5 times, but the compare code will have to run 15 times in order to compare the other values required to sort the values.
## Question 33
![33](https://github.com/lucap2527/lucasus/blob/gh-pages/Screenshot%202022-04-24%20113039.png)
* All code options at hand will correctly pick out the max value, one thing I learned from this question is integer.MIN_VALUE will give you the smallest possible value for a integer value which is -2^31
## Question 35
![35](https://github.com/lucap2527/lucasus/blob/gh-pages/Screenshot%202022-04-24%20113407.png)
* 6 is returned as that is the smallest n value in the array that has a 8 in it, the other positions would've been outputted if that 6th term 8 was replaced with something else.
## Question 36
* Same code as above
* The midpoint will be calculated 11 times because that is how many times you will need to cut the data in half to find the target value confidently, you could do it less but at that point you would be estimating to a certain degree.
## Question 37
![37](https://github.com/lucap2527/lucasus/blob/gh-pages/Screenshot%202022-04-24%20114305.png)
* 2 and 3 are the only code options that properly give the intended result by concatenating the words or linking them together to give the intended string.
## Question 38
![38](https://github.com/lucap2527/lucasus/blob/gh-pages/Screenshot%202022-04-24%20114634.png)
* The code will scan throughout the array given called numbers and goes from right to left or end to beginning of the array and sees how many numbers are equal to the value being compared to. The method is reran everytime a number is compared to wether it is equal to or not with one less number in the array (the one compared to).
## Question 39
![39](https://github.com/lucap2527/lucasus/blob/gh-pages/Screenshot%202022-04-24%20115226.png)
* The code will first output the arraylist going down the terms in order just as they're provided then the next line will just be alex because that is what the for loop is setting all the terms to.
