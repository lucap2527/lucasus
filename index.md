## Comp Sci Weekly Learnings ##
* Our assignment this week consisted of creating a calculator using java and snippets providing by John Mortenson. These snippets provided the baseline for an assignment that has taught me so much about java including how to use different functions such as linked lists, queues, and queue functions such as pop. These functions are used for multiple different uses but in this situation they were used to make a calculator program. Here is some example code below!

## Queue Description ##
* The Queue interface present in the java.util package and extends the Collection interface is used to hold the elements about to be processed in FIFO(First In First Out) order. It is an ordered list of objects with its use limited to insert elements at the end of the list and deleting elements from the start of the list, (i.e.), it follows the FIFO or the First-In-First-Out principle.
* The remove() method of Queue Interface returns and removes the element at the front the container. It deletes the head of the container. The method throws an NoSuchElementException when the Queue is empty.
* In order to add an element in a queue, we can use the add() method. The insertion order is not retained in the PriorityQueue. The elements are stored based on the priority order which is ascending by default. 
## Other Learnings ##
* For the purpose of this assignment we had to use functions that were not previously described and familiar to us from previous expirience. In order to solve this issue some learning had to be done on my own time.
* Multiple tokens can be compared to one another such as greater than or less than the other token.
* Terms that consist of characters can also be compared, one can find their length and then use that length to compare it to another term. This provides the ability to compare non numeral data types in ways that you previously couldnt.
* An example of the above is shown in the picture below.

## Queue Functions ##
* There is a multitude of different functions one can perform with a stack, and with these are pretty much endless possibilities as to what you can do with these functions:
1. push (to add a new item to the top)
2. pop (to remove the most top item)
3. peek (to get the most top item)
4. isEmpty (to check whether the stack is empty)
5. size (to get the size of the stack)
6. search (to search for objects)
* Here's an example of some functions above at work:
